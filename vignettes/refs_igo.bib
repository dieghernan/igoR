    This article summarizes the Correlates of War Intergovernmental
    Organizations (IGO) Version 3.0 datasets. The new datasets include
    information about the population of IGOs in the international system and
    state participation in those formal international institutions from 1816 to
    2014. Consistent with Versions 2.0 and 2.3, Version 3.0 of the IGO data
    comes in three forms: country-year, IGO-year, and joint dyadic membership.
    This article briefly describes the data collection process and identifies
    important changes to the dataset before moving to analyze fundamental
    patterns in the data. Most notable among the changes from earlier versions
    of the data is the inclusion of annual membership data for the 1815–1964
    time period. In addition, we present information about the overall trends
    in the institutionalization of cooperation at both the global and regional
    levels, with the latter focusing on the interesting membership dynamics in
    Asia and Africa. We then track and discuss patterns in state memberships
    and examine how these changes manifest in the dyadic data. The article
    concludes with a discussion of how the COW IGO 3.0 data compare to other
    prominent datasets on state participation in international institutions and
    highlights some new areas of research that will benefit from the release of
    the updated IGO membership dataset.
